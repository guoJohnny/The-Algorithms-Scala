Implementation of various algorithms in Scala programming language

#### How to use this repository for learning purpose ?

 - [Download and install Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
 - Clone the repository on your local machine

   `git clone https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala.git`

 - Open the repository using an IDE (Preferably IntelliJ)

 - Enable auto-import to import the dependencies from build.sbt
 - Open the [src/main/scala](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/tree/master/src/main/scala) to view the algorithm implementations under various categories
 - Open [src/test/scala](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/tree/master/src/test/scala) to run the test cases and view the algorithm in action
 - Visit [Algorithms-Explained](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Algorithms-Explainations.git) to get a more detailed explanation about specific algorithms
 - Check [Algorithms Visualization](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/blob/master/Algorithms%20Visualization.md) for visualization of numerous algorithms  
 
#### How to contribute to this repository ?

#### Contributing Algorithms : (Make sure to check all the points below before opening a PR)

 - Make sure you follow proper coding standards and naming conventions. Please use [Binary Search Implementation](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/blob/master/src/main/scala/Search/BinarySearch.scala) and [Binary Search Test](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Scala/blob/master/src/test/scala/Search/BinarySearchSpec.scala) as a reference.
 - Add the algorithm implementation as an object and not as a class
 - Add proper comments about the algorithm implementation and the functions present in the algorithm
 - Add a test spec in the test folder under the same domain as that of your algorithm. PR without a test spec would not be accepted
 - Add at least 1 positive and 1 negative test in the test spec 
 - Raise a PR for the algorithm object file and the test spec
 - [How to write a test case in Scala](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/writing_your_first_test)
 
#### Contributing Tests :

 - You can contribute tests for a specific algorithm
 - Add as many tests as you can and try to cover all the border line test cases
 - Open a PR with for your testSpec
 - Make sure you are not adding redundant test cases
 - If you see that the algorithm fails for a particular test case, then open an issue with proper explanation.
